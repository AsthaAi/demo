- Only agents with a valid, issued identity can communicate with PayPalAgent.
- If an agent without identity (e.g., FakeAgent) tries to connect, you'll see:
  "Unauthorized access: No identity has been issued to this agent."
- If an agent from a different trust domain (e.g., MarketAgent) tries to connect, you'll see:
  "Policy violation: Trust domain mismatch."
