## How Agents Work Together

1. **User initiates a product search:**  
   The ResearchAgent finds and recommends products.

2. **User selects a product to buy:**  
   The OrderAgent prepares the order.

3. **Before payment:**  
   The RiskAgent analyzes the transaction for safety.  
   The PromotionsAgent checks for and applies any discounts.

4. **Payment processing:**  
   The PayPalAgent manages the payment flow, working with the RiskAgent for security.

5. **After purchase:**  
   The CustomerSupportAgent is available for refunds, FAQs, and support tickets.

- All agent-to-agent communication is subject to IAM and trust domain checks.

## Agent Middleware

All agents are initialized and managed through a secure middleware layer, ensuring that:

- Agents are only created when needed.
- Security checks and initializations are performed before any sensitive operation.
- Agent state is managed efficiently for the user session.

## Extending or Customizing Agents

ShopperAI's agent-based design allows for easy extension:

- New agents can be added for additional features (e.g., price comparison, loyalty programs).
- Existing agents can be enhanced with more sophisticated logic or integrations.
- Each agent is modular and can be tested independently.
